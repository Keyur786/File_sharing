Overview: Distributed File System designed to manage file operations across a network of servers. The system is composed of a main server, a PDF server, and a text server, each responsible for handling specific types of files. The architecture allows multiple clients to interact with the system as if they were communicating with a single unified server, despite the underlying distribution of files across multiple servers.

System Architecture :
The distributed file system is built around three core servers: the main server, the PDF server, and the text server. The main server acts as the central hub for client interactions, managing files by itself and routing PDF and text files to their respective servers. This setup ensures that each file type is managed by the server best suited for its handling, optimizing both storage and retrieval operations. Clients interact with the system through a set of predefined commands processed by the main server. The client interface abstracts the complexity of file distribution, presenting a seamless interaction with what appears to be a single server.

Implementation :
It is implemented using socket programming, with communication between clients and servers managed through TCP/IP sockets. The main server is designed to handle multiple clients simultaneously, using a multi-process architecture that forks a new process for each client connection. This approach ensures efficient management of concurrent client requests.
File distribution is managed by the main server, which uses file extensions to determine the appropriate server for each file. Source code files are stored locally, while PDF and text files are routed to the PDF and text servers, respectively. This architecture optimizes file storage and retrieval across the network.
Error handling and input validation are integral to the system, ensuring that commands are processed correctly and that any issues are promptly reported to the client. The codebase is thoroughly documented with comments to explain the functionality and logic behind key operations, facilitating understanding and future maintenance.
